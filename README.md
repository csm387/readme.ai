# README Generator

## Overview

The README Generator is a tool designed to automate the creation of README.md files for projects based on the source code and a set of predefined rules. The tool scans the project directory, reads source code files, and generates a comprehensive README file using a language model from OpenAI.

## Features

- **Command Line Interface**: Run the tool directly from your command line for quick and easy README generation.
- **Support for Multiple Programming Languages**: Recognizes and processes files with `.cs`, `.py`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.java`, and `.cpp` extensions.
- **Integration with AI**: Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo model to generate high-quality text based on the content of your project files.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure that you have .NET installed on your system to run C# applications.
   
2. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone this repository to your local machine.

3. **Navigate to Project**:
   Use the command line to navigate into the project directory.

4. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the following command to start the application:
   ```
   dotnet run --project ReadmeGenerator.CLI -- --cli
   ```

5. **Input Required Information**:
   - Enter the path to your project when prompted.
   - Provide your OpenAI API key to enable AI features.

6. **Generate README.md**:
   The tool will automatically generate the `README.md` file in the project directory you specified.

## How It Works

The `ReadmeService` class handles the generation process. Here’s a brief rundown:

- **Prompt Generation**: It constructs a descriptive prompt based on the content and structure of the input directory, particularly by scanning and summarizing the source code file contents.
- **AI Integration**: Using OpenAI’s API with the provided API key, the tool sends this prompt to the model and receives a generated markdown text formatted as README.
- **Output**: The generated README.md is then saved in the specified directory.

## Configuration

- **API Key**: You need to provide your OpenAI API key which the tool uses to communicate with the model.
- **Model**: By default, the tool uses the `openai/gpt-4-turbo` model, but this can be configured in the `ReadmeService` constructor.

## Limitations

- **Token Limitation**: The current implementation sets a limit on the maximum number of tokens (default 500 tokens) that it uses to generate the prompt. This may limit the detail in the README for larger projects.

## Contributing
